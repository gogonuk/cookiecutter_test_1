### Project Setup & Initial Pipeline

*   **Repository Review:** Conducted an initial review of the cookiecutter-generated repository structure.
*   **Makefile Enhancements:** Added `make train`, `make predict`, and `make features` commands to automate the workflow.
*   **Placeholder Scripts:** Created initial placeholder scripts for `dataset.py`, `features.py`, `modeling/train.py`, and `modeling/predict.py`.
*   **Basic Testing Setup:** Added basic `typer.testing` based tests for `dataset.py`, `features.py`, `modeling/train.py`, and `modeling/predict.py`.

### Core Pipeline Implementation

*   **Dependency Management:** Added `yfinance` and `ta` to `requirements.txt`.
*   **Data Acquisition (`make data`):** Modified `gogo_test/dataset.py` to download historical AAPL stock data using `yfinance` and save it to `data/raw/aapl.csv`.
*   **Feature Engineering (`make features`):** Modified `gogo_test/features.py` to calculate:
    *   Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    *   Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    *   MACD and MACD Signal
    *   Bollinger Bands (Lower, Middle, Upper)
    *   Lagged 'Close' and 'Volume'
    *   Simple Moving Average of 'Volume'
*   **Data Visualization (`make plot`):** Modified `gogo_test/plots.py` to plot 'Close' price vs. 'SMA'.

### Model Training & Evaluation

*   **Linear Regression Model:** Implemented a basic Linear Regression model in `gogo_test/modeling/train.py` to predict the next day's closing price.
*   **Random Forest Regressor:** Switched the model to `RandomForestRegressor` for potentially better performance.
*   **Walk-Forward Validation:** Implemented a robust walk-forward validation strategy in `gogo_test/modeling/train.py` for realistic time series model evaluation.
*   **Financial Metrics Calculation:** Added `calculate_financial_metrics` to `gogo_test/modeling/train.py` to compute:
    *   Total Return
    *   Sharpe Ratio
    *   Maximum Drawdown
    *   Number of Trades
*   **Strategy Refinement:** Introduced `prediction_threshold`, `transaction_cost`, `take_profit_percentage`, and `stop_loss_percentage` parameters to the trading strategy for more realistic backtesting.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning (Attempted):** Integrated `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning, but reverted due to computational intensity on local machine.

### Project Maintenance & Documentation

*   **Package Renaming:** Successfully refactored the project from `gogo test` to `gogo_test` (directory, `pyproject.toml`, and all imports) to resolve installation issues.
*   **README.md Update:** Proposed and implemented a comprehensive and appealing `README.md` reflecting the project's new purpose and structure.
